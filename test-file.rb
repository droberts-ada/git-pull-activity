# Welcome to the git pull activity! This file contains a bunch of
# steps to demonstrate the process of working together on a piece
# of code via git. In the interest of time we'll be uncommenting
# code rather than writing it, but the same principals will apply.

# Task 1: Pulling in changes
# One partner should uncomment this method, add and
# commit the changes and push to GitHub. The other
# partner should run git pull to retrieve the changes.
# def duck_noise
#   puts "quack"
# end

# Task 2: Same as task one, but switch roles
# def truck_noise
#   puts "honk"
# end

# Taks 3: Merging Changes
# One partner should uncomment one method, and the other
# partner should uncomment the other.

# def robot_noise
#   puts "beep boop"
# end

# def train_noise
#   puts "choo choo"
# end

# Task 4: Merge Conflict
#   1. Partner 1: Change this method to puts "tick", commit and push.
#   2. Partner 2: *Before pulling*, change this method to "tock" and commit.
#   3. Partner 2: Try to push. Git should warn you that your local copy is out of date.
#   4. Partner 2: Now run git pull. There's a merge conflict!
#   5. Partner 2: Work with your partner to resolve the conflict.
#                 - Use git add to mark a conflict as resolved.
#                 - Once you're done, use git commit to finish the merge.
#                 - Use git push to send the resolved changes up to GitHub.
